<ion-view title="Timeline">
    <ion-content class="timeline-page" direction="x">
        <div class="row timeline-marker">
            <!-- Display the hour markers at the top of the screen.
                 One hour should take up 25% (horizontally) of the screen.-->
            <div class="col col-25" ng-repeat="time in timerange track by $index">{{time}}</div>
        </div>
        <div class="timelines">
            <div class="row timeline timeline-marker" ng-repeat="calendar in calendars">
                <!-- Calculate the horizontal positioning of the elements.
                    This is divided into two parts:
                        'margin-left' is to care for the white space between the last calendar
                            event and the current one (or between 7am and the first event).
                        'flex' handles the amount of space the element should occupy given its duration.
                    We want to display four hours on one screen which makes 25% the equivalent for
                        one hour and what we use as a multiplier.
                    The rest of the logic is subtracting the time of the current event from the
                        time of the last event (or 7am for the first event).
                    Since this is very dynamic, I didn't find a way to do it in CSS without making
                        classes for every percentage and even then the percentage still would have
                        to be calculcated.-->

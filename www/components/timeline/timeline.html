<ion-view title="Timeline">
	<ion-content direction="x" padding="true">
		<div class="row timeline-marker">
			<!-- Display the hour markers at the top of the screen.
                 One hour should take up 25% of the screen.-->
			<div class="col col-25" ng-repeat="time in timerange track by $index">{{time}}</div>
		</div>
		<div class="row timeline timeline-marker" ng-repeat="calendar in calendars">
			<!-- Calculate the horizontal positioning of the elements.
                This is divided into two parts:
                    'margin-left' is to care for the white space between the last calendar event
                        and the current one (or between 7am and the first event).
                    'flex' handles the amount of space the element should occupy given its duration.
                We want to display four hours on one screen which makes 25% the equivalent for one hour
                    and what we use as a multiplier.
                The rest of the logic is subtracting the time of the current event from the time of the
                    last event (or 7am for the first event).
                Since this is very dynamic, I didn't find a way to do it in CSS without making classes
                    for every percentage and even then the percentage still would have to be calculcated.-->
